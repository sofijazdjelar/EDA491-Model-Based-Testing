# [Cucumber](http://cucumber.io)
Cucumber is an open source tool for creating automated acceptance tests. The tool was designed to support behavior-driven development (BDD) - an agile software development process that focuses on collaborative work among stakeholders. For instance, BDD involves using natural language and concrete examples to specify expected software behavior in a way that all stakeholders can understand. Cucumber uses a natural language parser called Gherkin to define executable test cases in a BDD style. **Testing Approach:** Behavior-driven testing. **Testing Level:** Acceptance testing. **Target Application Domain:** ???.

## Features
* Gherkin: Defined as a domain-specific language, Gherkin has no other application than Cucumber. With its set of 16 keywords, the language is simple and quick to be adopted by everyone. 
* CucumberStudio: A testing platform that allows the team to co-design acceptance tests. It provides a real-time environment for designing, executing, automating and refactoring tests. The platform is intended to be used by everyone in a software delivery team, i.e. customers, product managers, testers and developers.
* Cucumber for Jira: Gherkin specifications are accessible inside Jira and synched with code repositories. 
* Built in documentation: The specifications provide not only executable test cases, but also a description of what the system actually does in a language that everyone working on the project can understand.
* Reusability: Cucumber allows you to reuse steps in other steps. This is especially useful when a step extends another stepâ€™s behavior.

## Pros
* Acts as a bridge between business and technical staff. 
* Allows test cases to be written without knowledge of any code (allows the involvement of non-programmers).
* Supports many different programming languages and software platforms. 

## Cons
* Scenarios are only created for key examples of behavior which sometimes lead to low test coverage. 
* Cucumber works by mapping single steps of behavior to methods of code. This needs to be done and maintained by developers or testers. Thus, there is an overhead when using Cucumber compared to writing test automation directly in code. 
* Adds another layer of complexity.

## Required information / models
Using a set of keywords (e.g. Given, When and Then), the user specifies expected software behavior (derived from business requirements) in a so-called Feature File. The specifications consist of multiple examples, or scenarios. Each scenario is a list of steps for Cucumber to work through. When Cucumber executes a Gherkin step, it will look for a corresponding piece of code to execute in the Step Definition file. If there is an error or exception in any line of code inside the step definition, Cucumber will mark that in the result output and then move on to execute the next step. 

## Target platform and dependencies
Cucumber is written in Ruby and the tool is confirmed to work on Windows, OSX and Linux. Moreover, Cucumber supports many different programming languages (including Java, JavaScript, PHP, Net, Python and Perl) and almost all popular software platforms. Components needed to make Cucumber work are Ruby and the Ruby DevKit.  

## Updates
Cucumber has been regularly updated since launching in 2009. 
**Latest update:** March 17, 2020.
**First release date:** July 25, 2009.

## Licensing / Cost

## Usage examples
Below is a usage example of Cucumber in which a certain behavior of an ATM machine is specified. 
```
Scenario: Emil wants to withdraw money from his bank account at an ATM
    Given Emil has a valid Credit or Debit card
    And his account balance is $1000
    When he inserts his card
    And withdraws $450
    Then the ATM should return $450
    And his account balance is $550
```
